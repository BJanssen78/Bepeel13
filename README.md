> These wonderful beetroot burgers are always so popular in our café, so here is an easier version that still tastes fab. In this version we make a simple cashew feta that adds great flavour and texture to the burgers. They go great served with your favourite hummus and a quick salad.

### INGREDIENTS

* 60 g cashew nuts
* 400 g uncooked beetroot
* 140 g walnuts
* 80 g vegan cheddar cheese
* 20 g fresh mint
* 10 g firm tofu
* 1 lemon (juice)
* 100 g fresh breadcrumbs
* 150 g hummus

### INSTRUCTIONS
 
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C fan/200°C/gas 6. Line two baking trays with baking parchment.
2. Put the cashew nuts into a bowl and cover with boiling water, then leave to soak for 10 minutes.
3. Wash the beetroot and remove any dirt and blemishes, then peel and grate into a bowl. Finely chop the spring onions. Roughly chop the walnuts and put them on one of the baking trays.  Bake for 6–7 minutes, then remove and set aside.
4. Heat a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat. Once hot, add 1 table spoon of olive oil along with the beetroot, spring onions and 1 teaspoon of salt and cook for 4–5 minutes, stirring regularly. Remove and put into a large bowl to cool.
5. Grate the cheese and finely chop the mint leaves.
6. Drain and rinse the cashew nuts and put them into a food processor with the tofu, 2 tablespoons of oil, half the lemon juice, 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper. Blend until smooth, then add to the grated beetroot along with the cheese, walnuts, breadcrumbs, the rest of the lemon juice, the mint, 1⁄2 teaspoon of salt and 1⁄4 teaspoon of black pepper.
7. Mix well, then divide the mixture into 4 even portions and shape into burgers. Place on the second lined baking tray and bake for 25 minutes.Remove and serve with hummus on top.

### ADDITION
When we first created our Beetroot, Walnut and Feta Burgers, you all loved them. So, with the dream of making them as easy as possible, we returned to the drawing board. They needed to still pack a punch, but only use 10 ingredients or less.

We think the cashew feta cuts through the sweet beetroot just perfectly and makes the burgers so indulgent, if you fancy a big feast. This recipe also goes incredibly well with a pesto, much like our spicy red pepper pesto, just smeared on top before adding whatever toppings you fancy.
If you have any stale bread in your kitchen that you don’t want to throw out, this is the perfect excuse to whizz them up in a blender or even use a grater and make your own bread crumbs. Equally you can swap out whatever herbs you have, for mint. We think mint, feta and beetroot are a match made in heaven, but we’ve used basil and coriander in the past and they’ve turned out delicious.

Beetroot Benefits: Beetroot is packed with antioxidants, evident from its bright red colour. When we first opened our juice bar, our aprons and hands used to be stained pink from juicing fresh beetroots. A simplistic way to think of antioxidants and their benefits for the body is that another name for rust is oxidation, so antioxidants help slow down the build-up of ‘rust’ in our body by slowing down cellular degradation. Research published in the journal Nutrients showed that eating beetroot can help dilate blood vessels because of its dietary nitrates, enhancing our physical performance.

It really is a winner, this dish. If you want to see how we make it, step-by-step, click our video below. It really is so simple and so delicious. If you have any questions about this dish, feel free to drop a message below and we’ll get straight back to you.
